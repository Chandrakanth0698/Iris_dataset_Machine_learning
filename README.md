# Machine Learning Project: Iris Dataset Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that uses the famous Iris dataset to demonstrate a simple classification task. The project showcases how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train a machine-learning model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using:
